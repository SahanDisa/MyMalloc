mymalloc.h - header file of the malloc functions
	     work as the interface 
mymalloc.c - all implementation part is done in here

mymalloc.o - that can be linked into other programs that use mymalloc
		gcc -o mymalloc.o -c mymalloc.c

Use the malloc in other programs -
               - Add an include line (#include "mymalloc.h") 
		 in all program source files that use library definitions (e.g test.c)
	       - Link the program's .c file with the library object file 
			gcc test.c mymalloc.o

Then Run the Executable e.g a.exe
